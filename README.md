Cards
=====

Symbian CARDDAV client prototype.

These are the sources of a prototype made at the beginning of 2013 just before google retired CARDDAV access.
Since then, in June 2013, Google introduced CARDDAV back, but with OAuth.
I am now working on enabling OAuth, but in case I don't have time, I put up the sources. 

The code just queries the cards from the server and inserts them sorted into a list. From there, you can call or email or SMS.
No sync is provided.
